    SMERF - Simple MEta Rails Form Plugin Generator
    -----------------------------------------------
    This generator sets up the required files so that you can start using 
    SMERF with your application. SMERF allows you to easily define dynamic  
    forms which you can use for surveys, questionnaires, and data collection  
    forms for example.

Requirements:

    1. You need to have a table that stores details about the users of your
       application. SMERF will keep track of the forms a user completes as
       well as the users responses to questions on these forms.
    2. The name of this users table as well as the primary key and model needs
       to conform to the Rails convention, i.e.     
       - DB table name needs to be plural, e.g. users
       - Primary key assumed to be named id
       - Model name is singular of the DB table, e.g. user
    3. SMERF is a RESTful plugin
    4. It has only been tested with Rails V2

Actions:

    The generator performs the following actions:
    
    1. Generate a migration file for the DB tables required by SMERF
       and uses the UserModelName parameter you specify
    2. Create route entry in routes.rb
    3. Create the smerf directory and copy an example form definition file
    4. Copy example stylesheet and required images to the public directory
    5. Copy the smerf helper file to the lib directory
    6. Setup the plugin to work with your user model name

Example:
    `./script/generate smerf user`
