SMERF - Simple MEta Rails Form Plugin Generator
===============================================

A. Completing the Installation
------------------------------

1. Run the DB migration

rake db:migrate

2. Include smerf in the controller where it will be used, if you want all 
controllers to have access add it to the application.rb, e.g.

include Smerf

3. Set the record ID of the current user so that SMERF can save responses 
for each user. This can normally be done once the user has been authenticated 
by using the following code as an example:

self.smerf_user_id = current_user.id

4. You can use the example stylesheet(smerf.css) supplied with the plugin 
which was copied to the /public/stylesheets directory by adding it to your 
application layout, e.g.

<%= stylesheet_link_tag "smerf", :cache => true  %>

5. To create a link to display a form you can use the Standard REST Path 
method used for the show action passing the name of the form definition file
as a parameter, for example

link_to('Complete Test Smerf Form', smerf_url('testsmerf'))

B. Testing your installation
----------------------------

To test the installation you can display the test form that comes with SMERF when
you install it. Everything will work as is as long as you have an existing user record
with id = 1. If not you need to modify the smerf_test_cotroller.rb file found
in vendor/plugins/smerf/app/controllers.

Simply change the line 

    self.smerf_user_id = 1

and set smerf_user_id to an existing user record id.

To display the SMERF test form by doing something similar to this

http://localhost:3000/smerf_test
